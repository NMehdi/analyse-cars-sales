# Analyse cars sales

The objective of this analysis is to help the sales director to prepare his next targeted advertising campaign. Using the data from a previous project that gathered several consumer traits for 200,000 transactions in France in 2016, the objective is to increase the revenues of three car models (Kadjar, Clio and MÃ©gane).

Targeted advertizing is a form of advertizing that focuses on certain consumer traits. These traits may be related to socio-demographic aspects such as income level, age, sex or to behavioral ones such as personality, preferences, etc... With the rise of the internet and social media, it is possible to track this data, assess specific traits and personalize advertizing campaigns.

The director of the Renault sales and marketing division wants to use this data to prepare a targeted advertizing campaign. Its objective is to increase the revenues for three car models (Kadjar, Clio and Megane). 

For this challenge I'll recommend a specific advertizing campaign based on my findings and quantify expected outcome, using previous project that has gathered several consumer traits for 200 000 transactions in France in 2016.
